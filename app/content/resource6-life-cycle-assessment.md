## Introduction to Life Cycle Thinking and Life Cycle Assessment
### Life Cycle Thinking (LCT)  
Life cycle thinking (LCT) has become an important approach on which businesses increasingly rely to inform decision-making and to identify opportunities to offset negative impacts. LCT is essential because it can help lessen the negative and improve the positive impacts of products and services by informing the design and decision-making process.  When you use life cycle thinking, your decisions should "reflect a broad perspective and include consideration of the full life cycle of the product." This includes considering impacts to workers, consumers, and the environment across the life cycle and the supply chain.(IC2) LCT is used to identify life cycle stages where there are significant differences between alternatives. It helps prevent burden shifting, i.e. ensuring that changes at one stage of the life cycle, in one geographic region, or in one impact category do not result in increased impacts elsewhere. LCT can be used to evaluate impacts without the conducting a full LCA.
The basic tenets behind LCT are: 
- To think about a chemical/product/process not as a single, static, entity but as a dynamic continuum that starts with raw materials and ends with an EOL scenario. 

• To avoid undesirable burden shifting from one stage in a product life cycle to another due to changes in product formulation or design
• To look at product impacts from a cradle-to-grave (or “Cradle-to-Cradle”) perspective and to identify potential environmental, economic, or social impacts for each life cycle phase, in order to foster choices that support innovation and benefits over the full life cycle."
Life cycle thinking (LCT) and life cycle inventory and life cycle impact assessment (LCI/A) allow you to consider and measure environmental impacts from materials and products across the life cycle. 
Life Cycle Assessment
LCA is a tool that allows quantitative assessment of differences between materials for a set of impact categories. Designers should evaluate options using LCT first to screen materials for obvious differences in sustainability performance. Then, where it is more difficult to distinguish sustainability impacts, materials should be evaluated and compared using LCA. 
LCA is a standardized methodology (ISO 14040 series) for accounting for aspects and impacts tied to material and energy inputs and emissions associated with a product, process or service. Results vary depending on how the system boundaries are defined. It is often used to find ‘hot spots’ or areas of greatest impact to identify and target opportunities for improvement.   
"An LCA includes:
•  Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases for all life cycle phases evaluated. (Life cycle inventory)
•  Evaluating the potential environmental and human health impacts associated with identified inputs and releases from processes within phases evaluated. (Life cycle impact assessment)
•  Interpreting the results to help make an informed decision."
