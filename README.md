# PrISM

**What is this?**

The _PRoduct Innovation and Social Mapping (PrISM‚Ñ¢) Tool_ is a project for [Northwest Green Chemistry](https://www.northwestgreenchemistry.org/) created by [Seattle GiveCamp 2018](http://seattlegivecamp.org/) volunteers. It is intended to support material product designers in developing products based on sustainable green chemistry and engineering design principles.

**Where is my data stored?**

Your data is maintained in local storage. When you select an existing project that you have worked on previously, you should see your previously-entered answers in the evaluation form. You can load a project you have already created and re-evaluate at any time.

Northwest Green Chemistry does not transmit client data to a server or maintain your company data. Please keep your local project data if you wish to revisit your evaluation.

**How do I download it?**

*TBD after packaging.* üôÉ

**How do I use it?**

The first time you open *PrISM*, you'll see an introductory page. Click the right arrow to proceed to navigation.

Choose a product name in the upper right menu if you are returning to a design evaluation, or select `--New Product--` and give the product being evaluated a name.

Select a section of the navigation wheel to begin or proceed with your design evaluation.

You may download a PDF report at any point in the process that should help you identify areas of focus for your design lifecycle.

# For Developers

**If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [electron-react debugging guide](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git; then install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd PrISM
$ yarn
```

## Run
Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:
```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:
```bash
$ yarn start-renderer-dev
$ yarn start-main-dev
```

If you don't need autofocus when your files was changed, then run `dev` with env `START_MINIMIZED=true`:
```bash
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,

```bash
$ yarn package-all
```

## How to add modules to the project

There have been several modules added to this project, including [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) to reuse react UI components.
Data is managed client-side with local storage.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please read the following section before installing any dependencies ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Module Structure

This boilerplate uses a [two package.json structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Two-package.json-Structure). This means, you will have two `package.json` files.

1. `./package.json` in the root of your project
1. `./app/package.json` inside `app` folder

### Which `package.json` file to use

**Rule of thumb** is: all modules go into `./package.json` except native modules, or modules with native dependencies or peer dependencies. Native modules, or packages with native dependencies should go into `./app/package.json`.

1. If the module is native to a platform (like node-postgres), it should be listed under `dependencies` in `./app/package.json`
2. If a module is `import`ed by another module, include it in `dependencies` in `./package.json`. See [this ESLint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md). Examples of such modules are `material-ui`, `redux-form`, and `moment`.
3. Otherwise, modules used for building, testing and debugging should be included in `devDependencies` in `./package.json`.

### Further Readings

See the wiki page, [Module Structure‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâTwo package.json Structure](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/wiki/Module-Structure----Two-package.json-Structure) to understand what is native module, the rationale behind two package.json structure and more.

For an example app that uses this boilerplate and packages native dependencies, see [erb-sqlite-example](https://github.com/amilajack/erb-sqlite-example).

## CSS Modules

This is configured to use [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) out of the box.

All `.css` file extensions will use css-modules unless it has `.global.css`.

If you need global styles, stylesheets with `.global.css` will not go through the
css-modules loader. e.g. `app.global.css`

If you want to import global css libraries (like `bootstrap`), you can just write the following code in `.global.css`:

```css
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```
